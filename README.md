Assignment 15
### Earthquake Visualization - Last 7 Days
##### GeoJson feed from United States Geological Survey (USGS)
At the time of the assignment, the most contrast in activity displayed in Alaska,
so Alaska was chosen as the center of the map.  Use the controls to look over other
areas of the United States and nearby countries with datapoints.

Kind assistance to get the legend to display was provided by AskBCS TA.
